In TypeScript, `unknown` is a type-safe counterpart to `any`. It represents any value **but requires you to perform type-checking** before performing most operations on it. This encourages **safer coding**.

## 🔍 What is `unknown`?

`unknown` is a TypeScript type that means:  
> “This value could be anything, but you can’t use it unless you first check its type.”

### ✅ Declaring unknown

```ts
let value: unknown;

value = 42;
value = "hello";
value = true;
value = { x: 10 };
```

Just like `any`, `unknown` can hold any value.

---

## ❌ You **cannot** do operations directly on `unknown`

```ts
let value: unknown;

console.log(value.toFixed(2)); // ❌ Error: Object is of type 'unknown'
```

---

## ✅ You **must** narrow the type first:

```ts
if (typeof value === "number") {
  console.log(value.toFixed(2)); // ✅ Safe, value is a number
}
```

Or use a type assertion:

```ts
console.log((value as number).toFixed(2)); // ✅
```

## 🔁 Comparison: `unknown` vs `any`

| Feature                  | `any`                   | `unknown`             |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Can hold any value       | ✅ Yes                   | ✅ Yes                 |
| Can perform any operation| ✅ Yes (unsafe)          | ❌ No, must check type |
| Type safety              | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes                 |

Using `any` disables type checking. `unknown` forces you to handle the type properly.

## 💡 When to use `unknown`

- When you're working with values you don’t know the type of **yet**.
- When you're building generic libraries or APIs.
- When parsing external data like JSON, and want to type-check it later.

---

## ✅ Example Use Case

```ts
function parseJSON(str: string): unknown {
  return JSON.parse(str);
}

const result = parseJSON('{"name":"Alice"}');

// Must check before accessing
if (typeof result === "object" && result !== null && "name" in result) {
  console.log((result as any).name);
}
```

---

## 🧠 Summary

- `unknown` means “we don’t know the type yet” **but want to stay type-safe**.
- It forces you to **narrow** or **assert** the type before using it.
- It’s safer than `any` and helps prevent runtime errors.
