Great question! Let's explore the **runtime behavior** of `enum`, `const enum`, and `union types` in TypeScript. This is key to understanding how your code behaves **after it's compiled** to JavaScript and how each construct affects **performance, file size, and runtime safety**.

# 🔍 Runtime Behavior of `enum`, `const enum`, and `union types`

| Feature                  | `enum`                        | `const enum`                      | Union Type (`'A' | 'B'`)         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Exists at runtime?       | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No (inlined at compile time)   | ❌ No                             |
| Adds to JS output?       | ✅ Yes (generates an object)   | ❌ No                              | ❌ No                             |
| Supports reverse mapping | ✅ Yes (only numeric enums)    | ❌ No                              | ❌ No                             |
| Type-safe?               | ✅ Yes                         | ✅ Yes                             | ✅ Yes                            |
| Best for...              | External APIs, runtime checks | Performance, inlining constants   | Pure type safety, simple cases   |

## 🔷 1. `enum` (Regular Enum)

### ✅ Exists at Runtime

When you define a regular `enum`, it is **compiled into a JavaScript object**.

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
```

### 🛠 Compiled JavaScript:

```js
var Direction;
(function (Direction) {
  Direction[(Direction["Up"] = 0)] = "Up";
  Direction[(Direction["Down"] = 1)] = "Down";
  Direction[(Direction["Left"] = 2)] = "Left";
  Direction[(Direction["Right"] = 3)] = "Right";
})(Direction || (Direction = {}));
```

### 📌 Behavior:
- **Bidirectional mapping**: You can do `Direction[0]` → `"Up"` or `Direction.Up` → `0`
- **Code size**: It adds an actual object to your output bundle
- **Runtime use**: You can inspect, loop through, or reflect on the enum

## 🔶 2. `const enum`

### 🚫 Does *not* exist at runtime

```ts
const enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
```

### 🛠 Compiled JavaScript:

```js
let move = 2; // Direction.Left is replaced by 2 directly
```

### 📌 Behavior:
- **Inlined** values: Every use of `Direction.Left` becomes `2` at compile time
- **No object generated**, so it’s faster and smaller
- **No runtime reflection**, reverse mapping not possible
- Requires full enum definition to be available during compilation
- Not allowed with dynamic or computed values

✅ **Best for performance-critical or memory-sensitive applications**

---

## 🔴 3. Union Types

```ts
type Direction = "Up" | "Down" | "Left" | "Right";
```

### 🛠 Compiled JavaScript:

```js
// Nothing at all!
```

### 📌 Behavior:
- **Completely erased** from JavaScript
- Only exists at **compile time**
- ✅ TypeScript uses these for **type checking only**
- ❌ No runtime validation, you must manually validate if needed

✅ **Best for modeling string literals without adding any runtime weight**

| Bundle size impact     | 🔺 Bigger                      | ✅ Smaller                        | ✅ Smallest                    |
| Runtime inspection     | ✅ Can reflect/iterate         | ❌ Cannot reflect                 | ❌ Cannot reflect              |

## 🧠 When to Use What?

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| You need runtime inspection, reflection, or dynamic logic | Use **`enum`** |
| You want performance and no runtime cost | Use **`const enum`** |
| You only need compile-time type checking | Use **`union types`** |

---

## 🚨 Gotchas

- `const enum` can’t be used with dynamic imports or isolated modules unless `preserveConstEnums` is false.
- Union types are **type-safe but not self-documenting**—they don't exist at runtime.
- Enums can cause unexpected behavior in tree-shaking and optimization.
