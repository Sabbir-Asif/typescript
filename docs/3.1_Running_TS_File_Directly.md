# **you *can* run TypeScript files directly** — **without manually compiling to JavaScript first**.

But **you need a special tool** for that, because Node.js itself does not understand `.ts` files natively.  
Here’s how you can do it:

---

# 🚀 Option 1: Use `ts-node`

[`ts-node`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/) is a popular tool that compiles and runs TypeScript *on the fly*.

### Step-by-Step:

### 1. Install `ts-node` and `typescript`:

Since you already have `typescript`, just install `ts-node`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ts-node
```

(You can also install it globally if you want: `npm install -g ts-node`.)

---

### 2. Now run your `.ts` file directly:

```bash
npx ts-node src/app.ts
```

It will instantly compile `src/app.ts` in memory and run it — no `dist/` folder, no JS file created!

---

# 🛠 Bonus: Add a script in `package.json` for easier running:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ts-node src/app.ts",
  "build": "tsc"
}
```

Now you can simply run:

```bash
npm run start
```

It will directly run your `app.ts`!

---

# ⚡️ Why/when should you use `ts-node`?

| Use case | Should you use `ts-node`? |
|:---|:---|
| Development (local testing, quick experiments) | ✅ YES, it's fast and easy |
| Production (live servers, real deployment) | 🚫 NO, always build `.js` files and run them for better performance and reliability |

---

# 📢 Important:

- `ts-node` is slower than running plain `.js` because it compiles on the fly.
- In production, **always compile TypeScript to JavaScript first (`tsc`)** and run JavaScript files.

---

# 🧠 Final Example Summary

| Situation | Command |
|:---|:---|
| Normal TypeScript build and run | `npx tsc` → `node dist/app.js` |
| Directly run TypeScript | `npx ts-node src/app.ts` |
