In JavaScript and TypeScript, `undefined` and `null` are both used to represent **"no value"**, but they are **not the same**. Here's a clear breakdown of their **differences** in terms of definition, behavior, type system, and common use cases:

---

## 🔍 Definition

| Concept     | `undefined`                            | `null`                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Meaning     | A variable has been declared but not assigned a value | An intentional absence of any value |
| Type        | `undefined`                            | `object` (yes, this is a legacy quirk) |
| Default     | Automatically assigned by JavaScript   | Must be assigned explicitly by the developer |

---

## 📦 Example

```ts
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null
```

---

## 🔁 TypeScript Type Differences

```ts
let u: undefined = undefined;
let n: null = null;
```

- By default, `undefined` and `null` are **subtypes** of all types in TypeScript when `--strictNullChecks` is **off**.
- With `--strictNullChecks` **on**, you must explicitly include them in unions:

```ts
let value: string | undefined;
let input: number | null;
```

## 🔧 Common Use Cases

| Use Case              | `undefined`                                   | `null`                                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Uninitialized variable | ✅ Commonly used                             | 🚫 Rare                                           |
| Function return value  | ✅ If no return statement                    | 🚫 Not returned by default                        |
| Missing function param | ✅ Common                                     | 🚫 Rare                                           |
| API data               | 🚫 Rare (APIs usually use `null`)            | ✅ Often used to represent “no value”            |
| Manual clearing        | 🚫 Not common                                 | ✅ Explicitly used to empty a field              |

---

## 🧪 Equality

```ts
null == undefined   // true (loose equality)
null === undefined  // false (strict equality)
```

So they are loosely equal, but not strictly equal.

---

## 🧠 When to Use What?

- Use `undefined` when:
  - A value **was never assigned**.
  - A **function didn’t return** anything.
  - You're using **optional parameters or properties**.

- Use `null` when:
  - You want to **explicitly clear** a value.
  - You need to **represent intentional absence**.
  - You’re working with **APIs or databases** where `null` is standard.

## ✅ Summary

| Aspect              | `undefined`                          | `null`                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Auto-assigned?      | Yes (uninitialized variables, missing args) | No (must be manually assigned)         |
| Indicates           | Missing or uninitialized              | Explicitly no value                     |
| Type                | `undefined`                          | `object` (legacy)                       |
| Common in functions | Yes (missing return or param)        | No (used when explicitly needed)        |
| Preferred when      | Default/implicit emptiness           | You want to be explicit about emptiness |
