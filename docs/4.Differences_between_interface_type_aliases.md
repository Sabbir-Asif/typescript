In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` can be used to describe the shape of an object or a data structure — but they have some important **differences**, especially in how they behave and what they support.

---

## 🧱 1. **Basic Usage: Similar Purpose**

Both can describe object shapes:

```ts
// Using interface
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Using type alias
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

✔️ This works identically — you can use either.

---

## 🔁 2. **Extension & Inheritance**

### ✅ `interface` supports **declaration merging** and **extends** keyword:
```ts
interface A {
  x: number;
}

interface A {
  y: number;
}

const obj: A = { x: 1, y: 2 }; // ✅ Works: merged

interface B extends A {
  z: number;
}
```

### ❌ `type` does **not** merge, but supports `&` intersections:
```ts
type A = {
  x: number;
};

// ❌ This is an error:
// type A = {
//   y: number;
// };

type B = A & { z: number };
```

So:
- `interface` is more **open for extension**.
- `type` is more **strict and closed**.

---

## 🧬 3. **Unions & Primitives**

Only `type` can define:
- Union types
- Primitives
- Tuples

```ts
type Status = 'success' | 'error'; // ✅ union
type ID = number | string;
type Point = [number, number];
```

❌ `interface` **cannot** do this.

---

## 🏗️ 4. **Use with Classes**

Both can be used to type-check a class, but `interface` is preferred:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  greet(): void;
}

class User implements Person {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```

✔️ `interface` integrates more naturally with `implements`.

---

## 🧪 5. **Performance in Compilation**

- `interface` is generally more **performant** in the TypeScript compiler for large codebases.
- `type` can sometimes slow things down when deeply nested or overly intersected.

---

## 🧠 When to Use What?

| Scenario | Prefer |
|:---|:---|
| Object shape | `interface` (more extendable, mergeable) |
| Union types / tuples / primitives | `type` |
| React props | Either (community is split; both are valid) |
| Complex types (mapped, conditional) | `type` |
| You need declaration merging | `interface` |

---

## ✅ TL;DR

| Feature | `interface` | `type` |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Extends/inherits | ✅ `extends` | ✅ `&` (intersection) |
| Declaration merging | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Unions, tuples, primitives | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Preferred in class `implements` | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Possible but not idiomatic |
| Compiler performance | ✅ Slightly better | ⚠️ Can get slower with complex types |
